  # NATOURS API v1
  
  # ðŸš€ Get started here
  
  This template guides you through CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), variables, and tests.
  
  ## ðŸ”– **How to use this template**
  
  #### **Step 1: Send requests**
  
  RESTful APIs allow you to perform CRUD operations using the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.
  
  This collection contains each of these [request](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/) types. Open each request and click "Send" to see what happens.
  
  #### **Step 2: View responses**
  
  Observe the response tab for status code (200 OK), response time, and size.
  
  #### **Step 3: Send new Body data**
  
  Update or add new data in "Body" in the POST request. Typically, Body data is also used in PUT request.
  
  ```
  {
      "name": "Add your name in the body"
  }
  
   ```
  
  #### **Step 4: Update the variable**
  
  Variables enable you to store and reuse values in Postman. We have created a [variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) called `base_url` with the sample request [https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me](https://postman-api-learner.glitch.me). Replace it with your API endpoint to customize this collection.
  
  #### **Step 5: Add tests in the "Scripts" tab**
  
  Adding tests to your requests can help you confirm that your API is working as expected. You can write test scripts in JavaScript and view the output in the "Test Results" tab.

  ## ðŸ’ª Pro tips
  
  - Use folders to group related requests and organize the collection.
      
  - Add more [scripts](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/intro-to-scripts/) to verify if the API works as expected and execute workflows.
